Description: 
    Zinck exploits a zero-inflated variant of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model 
    to generate valid knockoffs that capture the key characteristics of microbiome data - 
    mainly its compositional nature and high sparsity. It exhibits the properties of 
    simultaneous variable selection and FDR control to identify microbial biomarkers. 
    This package provides an implementation of zinck, which is trained either using the 
    Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) algorithm or using a collapsed 
    Gibbs sampler, facilitating variable selection for both continuous as well as binary outcomes.
