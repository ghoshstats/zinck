#' CRC data (species level)
#'
#' This dataset contains data from a meta-analysis of five geographically and technically diverse fecal shotgun metagenomic studies of colorectal cancer (CRC, n = 574). All raw sequencing data across studies were reprocessed using the same bioinformatics pipeline for taxonomic profiling. 
#' The 5 studies involve subjects from 5 different countries. The sample size of the studies is 109, 127, 120, 114, and 104; and the number of cases and controls are roughly balanced in each study. This data-set contains p = 849 species found among all the investigated metagenomic CRC studies.
